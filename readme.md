The oringinal inspiration: https://www.hanselman.com/blog/my-ultimate-powershell-prompt-with-oh-my-posh-and-the-windows-terminal

Pre-reqs to make the following work:
- Terminal-Icons for fancy icons: https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons
- Oh-My-Posh set up for Windows via: https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows
- Nerd-Fonts: https://www.nerdfonts.com/

Should be just a plug and play by dropping these two files into your $HOME\Documents\PowerShell directory.
